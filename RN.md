+ My self constructed RNA-seq library were completed and sent out this month. It is a long journey to follow a 10-pages modified protocol to finish this work. But everything fortunately was made smoothly. Glad to see how domesticated and relative wild species performance on simulated high planting density conditions.

Had lunch with Prof. Michael Freeling, who is the major advisor of my advisor. He wanted to chanllenge something that he is not that good at after he made the super accomplishment in the academia. Yup, that is we always want to see ourself in mirror in order to make a better self.

Using Lemnatec Automatic greenhouse system to estimate the water use efficiency of various species and varieties within each species. Sorghum and millets on right side apparently use water in a more efficient way than maize, valuable to dig in.

First time to attend a professional conference and be proud to give my first time oral presentation in 58th maize genetics conference holden in Jacksonville, Florida. My very first author paper's link related to this topic is [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157942). Regretably I am hidden in front of my slides ...

Transit from bench work to computer work and it is the first wet lab experiment I did in Schnable Lab. Data collection is a
first step, modified a large-scale DNA extraction methods, and successfully extracted large amount of DNA for Paspalum,
Dichanthelium and Urochloa.
