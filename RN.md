01-2019
+ My [GPWAS paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/534503v2) was posted in preprint server and this is one of my most interested works in my PhD. Integration of hundreds of phenotypes to investigate gene properties of maize from multiple perspectives, such as evolutionary features, expression and synteny analysis. Must be a potentially valuable guide for studies in other species with similar dataset of genomics and phenomics in upcoming decades. 

+ Attended my first PAG meeting, and presented my research on solving complexity of phenomic data using genomic data. So many people expected to see the whole story and I believe the paper should come very soon !!

+ Great honor to have lunch with [Prof. Steve Briggs](http://briggs.ucsd.edu/index.html). Not only his researches, but also plentiful advise on job hunting, performance in academia and lab management impressed me a lot.

+ It's awesome to attend [Prof. Sanzhen Liu](https://plantgenomics.ksu.edu/liulab/)'s talk. Great work on candidate pathogen resistance gene selection and mini-chromosomes characterization on pathogenic strains!

+ The second time joined the Plant Science Innovation retreat, the advent of big data is coming. High-throughput phenotyping, microbiomes, RNA-seq and metabolite data are being generated. Intriguingly seeing how to couple these data to generate interesting stories.     

<hr>

Transit from bench work to computer work and it is the first wet lab experiment I did in Schnable Lab. Data collection is a
first step, modified a large-scale DNA extraction methods, and successfully extracted large amount of DNA for Paspalum,
Dichanthelium and Urochloa.
