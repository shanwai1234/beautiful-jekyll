[**Phenomic Selection Is a Low-Cost and High-Throughput Method Based on Indirect Predictions: Proof of Concept on Wheat and Poplar**](http://www.g3journal.org/content/8/12/3961). 

Genomic selection is a molecular marker-based methods on accelerating selection in breeding. Recent developped technologies expanded phenotypes from another side of view on examing phenotypes that we could collect and may reflect different aspects of plants. A paper used the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to extract features from plants to achieve an expected prediction ability with genomic selections. But phenotyping is a non-destructive way to make this goal compared with GS.
