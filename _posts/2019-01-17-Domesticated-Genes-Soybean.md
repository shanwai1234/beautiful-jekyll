[**Identification of candidate domestication-related genes with a systematic survey of loss-of-function mutations**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tpj.14104). 

Domestication process is caused by human's intervene on variety selection, and therefore domesticated species always harbor a series of phenotypes related to this process, like more grain yield or less branes, which is called as "domestication syndrome". However, identifying domesticated genes are not an eay way. Commonly there are three ways to identify domesticated genes, which are GWAS, fine-mapping and selective sweep. An alternative approach can enlarge people's knowledge on these kinds of genes identification. This paper proposed a systematic approach for this purpose, which utilizes the LOF (loss of function) variants. LOF that is expected to appear in domesticated species more likely.
