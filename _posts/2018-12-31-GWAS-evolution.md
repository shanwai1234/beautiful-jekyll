[**What can genome-wide association studies tell us about the evolutionary forces maintaining genetic variation for quantitative traits**](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nph.14410). 

Understanding evolutionary relationship among genes belonging to a same family is broadly studied using homology methods and sequencing. However, exploring evolutionary forces in a population consisting of individuals collected from different geographical environments would be an interesting point to discover. This review summarized classical problems facing in conventional GWAS studies and evolutionary analyzes, which would be a very good source to build foundations in this specific areas.
