[**Deep Plant Phenomics: A Deep Learning Platform for Complex Plant Phenotyping Tasks**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.01190/full). 

Extracting numeric values in HTP is one of most chanllenging parts. UAV is gradually being applied in applied agricultural production, due to its convenience and high-throughput features. However, it is not easy to justify two-plot as one genotype in the field. But it is important to extract precise values from two-plot for downstream analysis like GWAS to discover potential links genes with the targeted trait. This paper proposes a promising strategy for accomplishing this. But it is unknown for its application on diverse data sets from multiple crop species.
