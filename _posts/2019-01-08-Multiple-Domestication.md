[**Parallel selection on a dormancy gene during domestication of crops from multiple families**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shulin_Liu8/publication/327846335_Parallel_selection_on_a_dormancy_gene_during_domestication_of_crops_from_multiple_families/links/5baacb7a299bf13e604c8d75/Parallel-selection-on-a-dormancy-gene-during-domestication-of-crops-from-multiple-families.pdf). 

I am working on testing hypothesis referring domestication under multiple species, and interestingly finding a paper talked about it. A dormancy gene that was selected during domestication of multiple crop species. A key word learnt from this paper which will be very useful and I am unsure before is "Domesticated species often exhibit convergent phenotypic evolution, termed the domestication syndrome, of which loss of seed dormancy is a component.". Also, it recapitulated important concepts in evolutionary study of parallel evolution, convergent evolution and divergent evolution.
