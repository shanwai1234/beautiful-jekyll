[**High-Throughput Phenotyping of Canopy Cover and Senescence in Maize Field Trials Using Aerial Digital Canopy Imagings**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/2/330/htm). 

Extracting numeric values in HTP is one of most chanllenging parts. UAV is gradually being applied in applied agricultural production, due to its convenience and high-throughput features. However, it is not easy to justify two-plot as one genotype in the field. But it is important to extract precise values from two-plot for downstream analysis like GWAS to discover potential links genes with the targeted trait. This paper proposes a promising strategy for accomplishing this. But it is unknown for its application on diverse data sets from multiple crop species.
